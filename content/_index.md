I'm Technical Director and Senior Software Engineer from Minsk, Belarus, working in web development, internet marketing and business automation.

I like to solve complex problems, work in a team and delight people.
When you look at the results of my work, you are smiling.

My job is to build your website so that it is **super fast**, functional and user-friendly but at the same time **attractive**. Moreover, I add **personal touch** to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use.

My goal is to realize all your desires and needs. Tell you "**Yes**", when the others say "No".
